# About Replit

We have a "Deploy to Replit" button for those people that like Replit ( Railway better ). We do not recommend using Replit.

## Why Replit bad?

* They do not allow unblockers on their site.
* You WILL get banned if you host a unblocker on Replit
* It is SLOW
* Deployment takes a looooong time
* Replit likes to break itself
* Railway is faster and also way better

You are probably better off going back to the README.md and deploying this on Railway.

Or, watch this video that may or may not help you:
